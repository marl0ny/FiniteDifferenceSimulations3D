# The Pauli field in 3D

The Pauli equation is numerically integrated explicitly by using a second order accurate centred difference approximation in time and a fourth order centred difference for each of the spatial derivatives.
Currently only 2D slices are displayed, as a full 3D render has yet to be implemented.
